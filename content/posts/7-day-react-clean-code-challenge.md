How is your new year resolution for 2022 going? Don’t worry if you missed items on it as you still have 2023. Join me on a free [7-Day React Clean Code Challenge](https://icodeit.ck.page/7-day-react-clean-code) to learn to write better React code with some practical techniques and pro tips.

In the challenge, you'll be asked to implement a full functional Todo application like this in 7 days:

In each day I'll give you enough tips and code snippets you'll need to finish the daily challenge. And from the second day on, I'll show you how I did it and how I cleaned the code up to a better shape as well as tips how you should do similar thing. 

At the end of the challenge, you will be able to identify common code smells and do the corresponding refactorings to fix them easily. 

## What will you learn?

- Fundamental React techniques (components and **common hooks**, like useState, useEffect, useMemo and `useCallback`)
- Apply **Test-Driven Development** in your React to protect yourself from making mistakes when adding new features
- Common **refactorings** and **clean code** skills to transform the code beautiful and **maintainable** when scaling
- Advanced techniques for clean up your code: **extract components** write **custom hooks** to capture reusable logic
