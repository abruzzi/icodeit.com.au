## Introduction to the mini-course

Welcome to the React and Test-Driven Development course! In this [comprehensive mini-course](https://icodeit.thinkific.com/courses/test-driven-development-with-react), you'll learn how to build a weather application from scratch using the latest and greatest in front-end development technology. With a focus on React, you'll learn how to develop components and build a user interface that is fast, responsive, and user-friendly.

One of the most exciting parts of this course is the emphasis on test-driven development (TDD). TDD is a software development approach that prioritizes writing automated tests before actually writing the code. This approach has been proven to increase the quality of code and reduce the amount of bugs in the final product. In this course, you'll learn how to implement TDD using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/), a popular and widely-used testing library for React applications.

Another key aspect of this course is mocking external APIs. To fetch data for our weather application, we'll be using [Mirage.js](https://miragejs.com/), a popular library for creating realistic mock data for testing purposes. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use React, React Testing Library, and Mirage.js to build a complete weather application that is fast, reliable, and easy to maintain.
