## A Little Backstory üï∞Ô∏è

Around March 2023, I found myself with an unexpected amount of free time. The frontend world is ever-evolving, and technology has a way of becoming obsolete quickly. Just two years after publishing the first edition, I noticed significant shifts in the landscape. Redux, once a go-to choice for many, is now considered more cautiously. The popularity of TypeScript has soared, replacing the likes of Flow and ESLint as the de facto standard for type-checking.

They say that behind every book lie a host of regrets‚Äîchoices set in ink that can't be changed. That's why the first edition focused on timeless principles, like refactoring basics and mocking & stubbing in tests. Yet, the second edition allowed me to address the unavoidable shifts in technology.

## What's Inside the Book? üìñ

This second edition brings fresh content and improvements to enhance your learning experience:

- New Chapter on Refactoring Fundamentals: This chapter introduces the core techniques of refactoring to make it easier for those just starting to write clean code.
- New Chapter on TypeScript: Given TypeScript's surge in popularity, this new chapter aims to get you up to speed with using it in a front-end context.
- Updated Code Snippets: All code examples have been revised and converted to TypeScript to align you with current best practices.
- Simplified Redux: In tune with the changing landscape, the Redux part of the book has been streamlined, giving you a focused look at state management in today's React apps.
